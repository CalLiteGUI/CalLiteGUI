      here can be used to turn on two different wheeling operations (CVC Wheeling and Joint Point
      of Diversion) and also the Delta-Mendota Canal(DMC)/California Aqueduct Intertie. &nbsp;For
      more description of wheeling operations, see the Reference Manual. &nbsp;The Intertie project
      allows the DMC and California Aqueduct to share conveyance capacity, thus increasing export
      capacity.</font>

      <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">&nbsp;Here the user can choose between
      different CVP and SWP allocation methods. &nbsp;Currently the only available allocation
      method is Water Supply Index/Delivery Index (WSI/DI) Curves, but other methods will be
      available in future versions of CalLite. Default&nbsp;WSI/DI&nbsp;curves for both CVP and SWP
      can altered here by clicking on the appropriate box and editing the values in table on the
      right side of the screen. &nbsp;<em>The user should be aware that the WSI-DI curves should be
      edited with caution.&nbsp; They are carefully developed through iterative running of CalSim
      II with a particular set of water supplies and demands.</em>&nbsp; More aggressive
      allocations may result in reservoir storage conditions that are not able to meet regulations
      through dry years.&nbsp; Relaxed allocations may result in storage levels that create higher
      flows in some months and unexpected modifications to Delta operations that are predicated on
      antecedent conditions.&nbsp; Results will not always be what the user intended.&nbsp; Careful
      analysis of output is always necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information about CalLite
      allocation methods, see Appendix E of the</font> <font face=
