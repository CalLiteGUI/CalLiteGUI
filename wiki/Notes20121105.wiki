Agenda:

1. Eclipse Juno configuration (Soumya)

Project-level properties
  Java Editor Save Actions
    - Enable project-specific settings
    - Format all lines
    - organize import
    - remove unused
    - 132 columns

2. Mainmenu.java

  - Package naming 

  - Packages should be for certain purposes
    - Organize around functionality, data flow
    - dependency flow; data access should not have dependency on UI (e.g)

Mainmenu is too long; initialization should be moved; xml version of GUI_LINKS.table files?

Breaking out into separate testable portions

Testing that GUI tables are valid v. building unit text;

Class-level 1-2 lines why is class here and responsibility. Add to methods as we have them.
