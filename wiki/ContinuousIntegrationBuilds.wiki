#summary A best practice of building continuously and often

= Introduction =

Jenkins is a simple and easy tool to get started with this practice.

= Details =

Ensure that java and ant are downloaded and on your path in a command line environment.

Download the jenkins.war from http://jenkins-ci.org/

java -DJENKINS_HOME=<some temp directory> -jar jenkins.war will start the Jenkins continuous build server

Goto http://localhost:8080 to configure/monitor/add it. There is a lot of documentation on how to configure it.

For the simple case of having it monitor and build callitegui simply add a new project and configure its SVN to point to the anonymous public svn url of the project

Next configure a ant task to build using ant/build.xml as the build file. Easiest done using the windows batch command option.
