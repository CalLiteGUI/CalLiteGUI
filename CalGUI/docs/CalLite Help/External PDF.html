    <h3>
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="4"><b>4.4. External PDF
      Dashboard</b></font>
    </h3>
    <p>
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">This dashboard allows the user to produce
      a standardized pdf report that compares the results of two CalLite (or
      CalSim)&nbsp;scenarios. &nbsp;The dashboard produces this report by calling one of the
      CalLite utilities, the CalLite report tool. &nbsp;The report shows storage in major
      reservoirs, flows at key river segments, CVP and SWP deliveries, and other scenario outputs.
      &nbsp;In order to generate the report, use the Select File buttons to&nbsp;select a report
      template file (.inp file),&nbsp;two DSS output files, and a report output file name; enter
      names for each of the two studies to be compared (defaults are set to CalLite 1 and CalLite
      2);&nbsp;and hit the Generate Report button. &nbsp;Optional information such as notes,
      assumptions,&nbsp;and modeler name can also be added to the report. &nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p>
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The default report template file
      (callite_scenario_comparison.inp) will compare two CalLite scenarios. &nbsp;The report tool
      can also be used to compare CalLite results to the results of a CalSim run. &nbsp;To do
      this,</font> <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">DSS Result File #1 must be set
      to the output DSS&nbsp;from the Calsim run, DSS Result File #2 must be set to the output
      DSS&nbsp;from the CalLite run; and the report template file must be set to
      calsim_callite_corroboration.inp. &nbsp;&nbsp;For more detailed description of the report
      tool, and instructions on how to edit the report template files,&nbsp;see Appendix J in the
      CalLite Reference Manual. &nbsp;</font>
