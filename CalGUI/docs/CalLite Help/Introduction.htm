       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">CalLite is an interactive screening model
      for Central Valley water management, which simulates the hydrology of the Central Valley,
      reservoir operations, State Water Project (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP) operations
      and delivery allocation decisions, Delta salinity responses to river flow and export changes,
      and habitat-ecosystem indices. &nbsp;CalLite contains much of the same functionality as the
      more detailed CALSIM II model,</font> <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">but
      is simplified in its spatial and hydrologic detail. &nbsp;The power of a screening model such
      as CalLite is the ability to rapidly simulate system operations and to incorporate changes
      with relative ease. The current version of CalLite simulates system operations on a monthly
      basis for the full 82-yr period of record in less than 5 minutes, and can be run with a
      variety of different options in terms of hydroclimate, demands, facilities and
      infrastructure, regulations, and system operations. &nbsp;But despite the simplifications
      included in CalLite, the model results correlate very well to those of a comparable CALSIM II
      study.</font>

       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">CalLite 2.0 is the newest version of the
      CalLite model, which&nbsp;is implemented using (1) a calculation engine developed using the
      Water Resource Integrated Modeling System (WRIMS), and (2) a customized GUI that replicates
      all of the functionality contained in previous versions of CalLite.&nbsp; WRIMS is the
      modeling platform used for the CALSIM II model, and implementing CalLite in WRIMS will
      improve the consistency of CalLite and CALSIM results and make it easier to maintain that
      consistency as both models evolve.&nbsp; The goal of Version 2.0 of CalLite is to provide the
      same capabilities and user-friendly interface as previous versions of CalLite, while
      maintaining a modeling structure that is as close as possible to the more detailed CALSIM
      model. &nbsp;</font>
