      Tab</b></font>
    </p>
    <p>
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The standards listed on this tab&nbsp;are
      from the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)
      Biological Opinions on operations of the CVP and SWP, released in Dec. 2008 and June 2009
      respectively. &nbsp;The specific standards here are Reasonable and Prudent Alternatives
      (RPAs) described in those Biological Opinions. &nbsp;See Appendix B in the User's Reference
      Guide for more description of these RPAs. &nbsp;As with D-1641 regulations, activating the
      appropriate checkbox will turn on the standard. &nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p>
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">While there are no user-defined options
      for these RPAs, for three of them there is a user-defined standard on another tab that could
      conflict with the RPA standard. &nbsp;This occurs for the Old and Middle River RPA (see the
      Other Regulation tab) and the Fall X2 and Delta Cross Channel RPAs (see the D-1641 tab).
      &nbsp;To reduce confusion about which regulatory standard to apply, these three RPA standards
      are always deactivated if the corresponding standard is user-defined, even if the RPA
      checkbox is checked, and in those cases only the user-defined standards
      apply.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p>
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The RPAs on this tab are:</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Old and Middle River (FWS RPA Actions
      1-3).</b></font> <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">This limits CVP and
      SWP&nbsp;exports so that flow in the Old and Middle River is no more negative than a
      specified standard during Dec-June. &nbsp;Depending on the time of year and
      hydrological&nbsp;and biological conditions this standard can vary from -1,250 to -5,000 cfs.
      &nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Fall X2 (FWS RPA Action 4).
      &nbsp;</b>This sets X2 standards for Sept-Nov, which are applied in Wet and Above Normal
      water years. &nbsp;Since this RPA applies in different months than the D-1641 X2 standard,
      both can be applied in the same scenario.</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Clear Creek (NMFS RPA Action 1.1.1).
      &nbsp;</b>This sets minimum flow standards in Clear Creek.</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Delta Cross Channel (NMFS RPA Action
      4.1.2).</b></font> <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">This defines the number
      of days that the DCC gates are open in each month. &nbsp;DCC operations under this RPA will
      always have no more days open than the D-1641 DCC standard, and in some months may have even
      fewer days open. &nbsp;Since this RPA was crafted as extra protection above and beyond the
      D-1641 standard, it will operate identically whether or not the D-1641 DCC standard is
      explicitly activated in the GUI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-San Joaquin River Inflow to Export
      Ratio (NMFS RPA Action 4.2.1).</b></font> <font face=
      "SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">This limits the combined exports of CVP and SWP to a
      fraction of San Joaquin River at Vernalis, which varies by water year type.</font>
