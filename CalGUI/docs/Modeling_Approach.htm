      "SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">2.0 of the CalLite screening model consists of a
      calculation engine produced using &nbsp;WRIMS and a standalone GUI that allows the user to
      design and run scenarios and view model results.&nbsp; WRIMS is a generalized water resources
      modeling system for evaluating operational alternatives of large, complex river basins.&nbsp;
      It was originally developed to implement the CALSIM model.&nbsp; WRIMS works by using a
      linear programming (LP)/mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver to determine an
      optimal set of decisions for each time period given a set of weights and system
      constraints.&nbsp; The system constraints and weights are specified and can be customized
      through use of the Water Resources Engineering Simulation Language (WRESL).&nbsp; For Version
      2.0 of CalLite, WRESL code was written to implement a simplified version of the system
      simulated in CALSIM, thereby reducing run time while still maintaining the key features of
      the system.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>

       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Figure&nbsp;1 shows the d	esign of this new
      WRIMS-based version of CalLite.&nbsp; The code for the model is written in the WRESL
      language, and then WRIMS is usd to compile that code into an executable (CalLite.exe) which
      does all of the model calculations.&nbsp; The distributed version of the model includes this
      executable along with the CalLite GUI.&nbsp; The user uses the CalLite GUI to design
      scenarios and specify any customized settings desired when running the model, and when told
      to run a scenario, the GUI calls CalLite.exe and runs the scenario, with all relevant
      settings specified in an .xml or .DSS files that are read in by CalLite.exe.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
      running the model copies all approriate input data to a temporary folder.&nbsp; Outputs from
      CalLite.exe are stored in the same format as CALSIM results (in a .DSS file), and the GUI can
      be used to view these outputs in graphical and tabular format.&nbsp;

       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">While most of the interactions shown in
      Figure 1 will be invisible to the user, use of WRIMS and WRESL will allow model developers to
      make changes as needed to the CalLite.exe calculation engine.&nbsp; So for example, changes
      could be made to add different management or regulatory options or update code to improve
      calculations or consistency with CALSIM.&nbsp; Likewise, the CalLite GUI can also be
      customized by developers in parallel with changes in the calculation engine.&nbsp; The
      GUI.xml file (see Figure 1) is used to specify the GUI options that will be available for a
      given version of CalLite.&nbsp; In addition to facilitating the normal process of updating
      and improving the software as time goes by, these features will allow developers to create
      customized versions of CalLite for different users and for different
      purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
