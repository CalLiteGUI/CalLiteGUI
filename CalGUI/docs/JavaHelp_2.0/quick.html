<h3><font style="font-size: medium; font-family: SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica;" 
			 size="4" face="Verdana"><b>4.1. Quick Results&#160;Dashboard</b></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">The 
 Quick Results dashboard is where graphs and tables can be generated for</font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">numerous 
 CalLite outputs, for one scenario or comparing different scenarios. &#160;The 
 different sections on this tab are as follows:</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Scenarios.</b></font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;Here 
 the user can add or delete scenarios from a list of scenarios whose results 
 will be displayed, and select the type of results to show (either for 
 a single scenario (Base option), a&#160;comparison of scenarios, or the 
 difference between scenarios). &#160;The radio button next to each scenario 
 name can be used to select which scenario to delet, and for difference 
 plots it also controls which scenario the other scenarios are compared 
 to when computing the difference values. &#160;&#160;&#160;</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Display.</b></font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;Has 
 a series of display options, which are:</font></p>
<p class="hcp3"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">-Starting and ending 
 month and year to display. &#160;</font></p>
<p class="hcp3"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">-Whether to show 
 flow data in cfs or taf. &#160;Plots of variables other than flow have 
 fixed units (taf for storages, umhos/cm&#160;for salinity).</font></p>
<p class="hcp3"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">-Whether to show 
 a monthly time series&#160;or exceedance plot. &#160;Exceedance plots 
 can be shown for individual months, all monthly values, or annual totals. 
 &#160;The annual total exceedance plots are only shown for flow variables 
 and the units are always taf.</font></p>
<p class="hcp3"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">-Whether to show 
 a table of monthly values. &#160;For flow variables this table will also 
 show an annual total which is always in taf.</font></p>
<p class="hcp3"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">-Whether to show 
 a summary table. &#160;The summary table can show five different statistics 
 (average, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, and median) computed from 
 monthly and annual values, summarized by four different water year types 
 and for the three driest periods in 1922-2003. &#160;When summarizing 
 data by water year type, the Sacramento Valley 40-30-30 Index, Feather 
 Index, and SJR</font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">(San Joaquin Valley 60-20-20)</font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">Index 
 use February as the first month of the water year, and the Shasta Index 
 uses March.&#160;&#160;</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Report List.</b></font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;This 
 section can be used to create reports which include different selections 
 of multiple graphs and tables. &#160;Clicking the Add to List button will 
 add a report to the list that includes all the variables whose checkboxes 
 are active with all the options selected in the Scenario and Display areas. 
 &#160;Reports on the list can then be displayed (singly or all at once) 
 and saved for later use. Saved lists can be reloaded using the Load List 
 button.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Output selection.</b></font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;Right-clicking 
 any of the variable names in this section will display graphs and tables 
 for that variable, and any variables with activated checkboxes can be 
 added to a report list (see above).</font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">The 
 Storage and Flows tab allows the user to choose from a variety of standard 
 output variables for flow, storage, and salinity. &#160;The Shortages/Flow 
 Objectives tab allows the user to display shortages in accretion/depletion 
 (AD) terms in the North of Delta area; and compare Delta outflow and Sacramento 
 and San Joaquin River flows to the SWRCB Delta Flow Criteria. &#160;The 
 Water Management Actions tab is currently not active. &#160;</font></p>
<p class="hcp4">When 
 graphs are displayed it is possible to zoom in by clicking and dragging 
 the cursor&#160;to the lower right to create a box. &#160;Once zoomed 
 in you can pan by holding down the left button and the Control key, and 
 then moving the mouse. &#160;Right clicking in the graph area will bring 
 up a menu that allows you to edit properties of the graph; copy, save, 
 and print the graph; zoom in, zoom out, and reset the plot to its original 
 zoom; and copy the data used to create the graph into the clipboard, from 
 where it can pasted into another application. &#160;Certain graphs also 
 display&#160;secondary time series (described in the legend) in addition 
 to the primary time series.</p>
