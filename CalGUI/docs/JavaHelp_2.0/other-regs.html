<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>3.5.3. 
 Other Regulations Tab</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">This 
 tab allows the user to activate three additional regulations and define 
 values for them in the table on the right side of the screen. &#160;The 
 month numbers in the user-defined tables refer to USGS water year months, 
 so Oct = 1, Nov =2 etc.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font>&#160;<font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;&#160;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">The 
 regulations available here are:</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-QWEST (San 
 Joaquin River near Jersey Point).</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">This 
 is a minimum flow standard on the San Joaquin River near Jersey Point. 
 &#160;The user can define values for this standard by month and water 
 year type.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Old and Middle 
 River. &#160;</b>This limits CVP and SWP&#160;exports so that flow in 
 the Old and Middle River (OMR)&#160;is no more negative than a specified 
 standard during Dec-June. &#160;Standards can be specified by month and 
 water year type. &#160;<em>When this standard is activated here, the OMR 
 standard on the Biological Opinion RPAs tab is automatically de-activated.</em></font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-San Joaquin&#160;River 
 Inflow to Export ratio with offset.</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;This 
 limits combined CVP and SWP exports to a cap computed based on San Joaquin 
 River flow at Vernalis. &#160;The cap is computed as = offset + multiplier 
 * Vernalis flow. &#160;The offset and multiplier values can be specified 
 by month and water year type.</font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><em>When this 
 standard is activated here, the SJR inflow/export ratio standard on the 
 Biological Opinion RPAs tab is automatically de-activated.</em></font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Fraction of 
 Unimpaired Flow for Delta Criteria.</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;In 
 July 2010 the State Water Resources Control Board&#160;issued a report 
 on Delta Flow Criteria. &#160;Here the user can activate those criteria 
 in the model (for Delta outflow, the Sacramento River, and the San Joaquin&#160;River) 
 and also specify different criteria if desired. <em>&#160;Note that unlike 
 all of the other regulations on this dashboard, when this option is activated, 
 CalLite does not force flows at these locations to meet these criteria.</em> 
 &#160;It only compares flows to the criteria and computes how much additional 
 water would be needed to meet the criteria, if it is not met.</font></p>
<p class="hcp3"><img 
	 src="icon-warn.png" alt="warning" width="25" height="24" border="0" />WARNING: 
 Any user defined values will be used in place of all D1641 and Biological 
 Opinions regulations. This applies to Old Middle River and San Joaquin 
 River Inflow/Export ratio user defined options.</p>
