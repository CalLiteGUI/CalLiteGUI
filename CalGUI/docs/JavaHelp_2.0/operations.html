<h3><font style="font-size: medium; font-family: SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica;" 
			 size="4" face="Verdana"><b>3.6. Operations Dashboard</b></font></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">The 
 operations dashboard has options relating to CVP and SWP system operations, 
 as follows:</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-CVP Operations 
 and Facilities.</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;The checkboxes 
 here can be used to turn on two different wheeling operations (CVC Wheeling 
 and Joint Point of Diversion) and also the Delta-Mendota Canal(DMC)/California 
 Aqueduct Intertie. &#160;For more description of wheeling operations, 
 see the Reference Manual. &#160;The Intertie project allows the DMC and 
 California Aqueduct to share conveyance capacity, thus increasing export 
 capacity.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-CVP/SWP Allocation 
 Methods.</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;Here the user can choose 
 between different CVP and SWP allocation methods. &#160;Currently the 
 only available allocation method is Water Supply Index/Delivery Index 
 (WSI/DI) Curves, but other methods will be available in future versions 
 of CalLite. Default&#160;WSI/DI&#160;curves for both CVP and SWP can altered 
 here by clicking on the appropriate box and editing the values in table 
 on the right side of the screen. &#160;<em>The user should be aware that 
 the WSI-DI curves should be edited with caution.&#160;&#160;They are carefully 
 developed through iterative running of CalSim II with a particular set 
 of water supplies and demands.</em>&#160;&#160;More aggressive allocations 
 may result in reservoir storage conditions that are not able to meet regulations 
 through dry years.&#160;&#160;Relaxed allocations may result in storage 
 levels that create higher flows in some months and unexpected modifications 
 to Delta operations that are predicated on antecedent conditions.&#160;&#160;Results 
 will not always be what the user intended.&#160;&#160;Careful analysis 
 of output is always necessary.&#160;&#160;For more information about CalLite 
 allocation methods, see Appendix E of the</font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">CalLite 
 Reference Manual.</font></p>
