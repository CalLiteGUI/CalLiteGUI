<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>3.5.1. 
 D-1641</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>Regulations Tab</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">The 
 regulations on this tab are all from the State Water Resources Control 
 Board Decision 1641 (D-1641). &#160;These regulations are summarized below, 
 but for more detail on the D-1641 standards, see Appendix B&#160;of the</font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">CalLite 
 Reference Manual. Clicking the checkbox next to a regulation will activate 
 it for the current CalLite scenario. &#160;For many of these standards, 
 the specific D-1641 standard can be replaced with a user-defined standard. 
 &#160;If this is desired, after turning on the regulation, click on the 
 radio button for User defined&#160;and enter desired values in the editable 
 table (on the right half of the screen). &#160;The month numbers in the 
 user-defined tables refer to USGS water year months, so Oct = 1, Nov =2 
 etc.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">The 
 regulations on this tab are as follows:</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Delta Cross 
 Channel (DCC).</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;This defines the 
 numbers of days that the DCC gates are open in each month. &#160;Operation 
 of the DCC assists in transferring fresh water from the Sacramento River 
 south&#160;across the Delta. &#160;Operations depend on water quality, 
 flood protection, and fish and wildlife requirements. &#160;The number 
 of days open each month can adjusted using the user-defined option.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Sacramento 
 River at Rio Vista Minimum Flow.</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;This 
 defines minimum flows at Rio Vista, which vary by month and water year 
 type. &#160;This standard can be user-defined.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Minimum Net 
 Delta Outflow.</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;This defines minimum 
 outflows through the Delta. &#160;The flow standard varies depending on 
 month, water year type, and other criteria as specified in D-1641. &#160;User-defined 
 values can be set by month and water year type. &#160;</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-X2 Requirements.</b></font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;The 
 X2 position is the distance (in kilometers) east of the Golden Gate Bridge 
 of the salinity level of 2 parts per thousand chloride. &#160;The goal 
 of this standard is to maintain the X2 position at or to the west of certain 
 specified locations. &#160;In D-1641 this standard is in place Feb-June 
 and is enforced in different locations (Roe Island, Chipps Island, Collinsville) 
 for different parts of each month depending on certain criteria discussed 
 in Appendix B of the</font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">User's Reference Manual. 
 &#160;&#160;When user-defined the X2 standard can be turned on or off 
 for each month, values can be set in kilometers by month and water year 
 type, and there is no Roe Trigger.</font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><em>When 
 this standard is user defined, the D1641 X2 on this tab and Fall X2 standard 
 on the Biological Opinion RPAs tab are automatically de-activated.</em>&#160;</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Roe Trigger. 
 &#160;</b>This trigger is normally a part of D-1641 regulations. &#160;Under 
 D-1641 standards, X2 is required to be at or west of Roe Island for a 
 certain number of days if the preceding month's X2 position is west of 
 Roe.&#160;&#160;If the preceding month's X2 position was east of Roe, 
 then the required number days west of Roe is automatically set to 0. &#160;If 
 the trigger is not used, then the required number days west of Roe</font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">is 
 always 0.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Export-Inflow 
 Ratio.</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">&#160;This limits the combined 
 exports of CVP and SWP to a specific proportion of total Delta outflow. 
 &#160;The D-1641 standard varies by month and river flow levels. &#160;When 
 user-defined this proportion (ratio) can be adjusted by month.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Vernalis (Vernalis 
 D-1641 Criteria). &#160;</b>This limits the combined exports of CVP and 
 SWP to the minimum of two different standards</font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">during 
 the Apr 15-May 15 pulse period. &#160;The first standard is from D-1641, 
 where&#160;exports are limited to&#160;the maximum of 1500 cfs or San 
 Joaquin River flow at Vernalis. &#160;The second standard is the VAMP 
 (Vernalis Adaptive Management Plan)&#160;export cap, which varies depending 
 on the VAMP pulse flows released during this same period. &#160;To be 
 consistent these VAMP&#160;pulse flows are only&#160;included in the San 
 Joaquin River flow into the Delta in CalLite when this export cap is on. 
 &#160;When it is off the pulse flow is turned off as well.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Salinity Standards</b></font> 
 <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">at 
 Emmaton and&#160;Jersey Point (for agriculture), Rock Slough (for M&amp;I), 
 and Collinsville (for fish and wildlife). &#160;In D-1641 these standards 
 vary depending on month and water year type.</font></p>
<p class="hcp3">&#160;WARNING: Any user defined values will be used in 
 place of all D1641 regulations. This applies to X2 and Inflow/Export ratio 
 user defined options.</p>
