Proposal

(1) policy for unsaved scenario:
	
	option 1. Don't allow user to run an unsaved scenario
	option 2. Allow user to run unsaved scenario, but save it automatically with a temporary name, e.g., using date and time, 

(2) When a scenario, e.g., “example1.cls” is saved,

	1. A folder with the same name as the .cls file “example1” is created in the “scenario” folder
	2. In the “example1” folder, a file named “example1.config” and a “Run” folder are created
	3. In the “Run” folder, “Lookup” and “External” folders are created
	4. CalGUI generates the table files for this scenario and place them in the lookup folder
	5. CalGUI Copy the required dll files for this scenario and place them in the external folder
	6. The "example1.config" file is similiar to the *.sty file
