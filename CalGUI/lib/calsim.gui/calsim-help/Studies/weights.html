</U></FONT><P>The priority for allocating water to competing uses is specified in this table.  Each arc, or arc zone, in which water is to be allocated is specified in this table with a corresponding weight.  The weight is a measure of the relative allocation priority for consumptive or non-consumptive uses. Storage arc zones are weighted separately to describe the operation rules of a reservoir in concert with upstream and downstream water uses.  Currently Calsim uses a standard linear programming solver, which maximizes all variables with weights higher than a given variable's weight before it will be considered within the constraints.</P>
<P>For example, a reservoir with a dead pool storage weight of 20,000 will not provide any releases to meet a downstream demand unless the demand is greater than 20,000.  Note that the dead pool storage may still drop below its maximum due to the evaporation constraint.</P>
