         HEC-DSS was the result of a need that emerged in the late 1970s.&nbsp; Before HEC-DSS,
        most hydrologic studies were performed in a step-wise fashion by passing data from one
        analysis program to another in a manual mode.&nbsp; While this was functional, it was not
        very productive.&nbsp; Programs that used the same type of data, or that were sequentially
        related, did not use a common data format.&nbsp; Also, each program had to have its own set
        of graphics routines or other such functions to aid in the program’s use.

         The Kissimmee River study was performed by HEC for the Jacksonville District beginning in
        1978 and required an orderly approach to properly manage the study data and analysis
        results.&nbsp; A large number of alternative plans and conditions were to be processed in
        this project.&nbsp; This study gave birth to the first version of HEC-DSS.&nbsp; The basic
        design provided for the storage of data in a standard form that was independent of any
        particular program.&nbsp; The data would be provided to the programs when it was needed and
        results would be stored in the same independent form for use by utilities and other
        applications programs.&nbsp; The early design of HEC-DSS was conceived to support files
        containing up to a few thousand data sets. As the use of HEC-DSS expanded into real-time
        data storage applications, data files were written to manage hundreds of thousands of data
        sets.&nbsp;

         The current HEC-DSS version is designed for rapid storage and retrieval of data sets from
        files containing as few as 40 to 50 data sets to files containing more than several million
        data sets.&nbsp; HEC-DSS Version 6-Qx and later can have database files up to 8 Gigabytes.
