        California CDEC Data</b></font><br>
        <br>
         You can optionally retrieve and import time-series data from the California CDEC database
        via the web using the <b>CDEC</b> plug-in tool.&nbsp; It can retrieve a variety of
        hydro-meteorological and environmental data from CDEC for stations throughout the state of
        California.&nbsp;&nbsp; You must enter the station information (station ID, sensor,
        duration code, and time window) manually into the plug-in table.&nbsp; The plug-in has no
        capability to identify which stations and what data is available from CDEC.&nbsp; Station
        ID and data availability can be obtained from the CDEC web site at:&nbsp;
        http://cdec.water.ca.gov.
      </p>
      <p class="bodytextindent1" style=" margin-left: 0.0px;">
         To use the <b>CDEC</b> plug-in you must be connected to the internet and the file CDEC.jar
        must be located in the <b>Plugins</b> directory for HEC-DSSVue.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Open your DSS file and select <b>CDEC (Web)</b> from the <b>Import</b> popup menu from
          <b>Data Entry</b> on the menu bar.&nbsp; This will open the <b>CDEC Download</b> plug-in
          interface with an empty station identifier table.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          You can either open a previously saved table or manually enter the station information
          for the stations that you want.&nbsp; The CDEC plug-in cannot populate the table; you
          must manually enter the station information.&nbsp;<br>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          To open a previously saved table, select the <b>File</b> menu and then <b>Open.</b>
          Browse to the directory and file that you want to access and then press the <b>Open</b>
          button.&nbsp; Optionally, you can select a file from the most recently used file list at
          the bottom of the <b>File</b> menu.&nbsp; To save a table, select the <b>File</b> menu
          and then <b>Save</b>.&nbsp; Browse to the directory where you want to save your table and
          then enter the file name and press the <b>Save</b> button.&nbsp; Tables are in text
          format and are saved with an extension of “.cdec”.
        </li>
        <li>
          To manually enter station information, select the CDEC Station ID cell on a blank
          row.&nbsp; Enter the ID and then fill in the basin or river name, location name and
          sensor number.&nbsp; For each sensor, a default C part will be provided; you can change
          the C part, if desired.&nbsp; Enter the duration code, which may be “Monthly”, “Hourly”,
          “Daily” or “Event”. &nbsp;The duration code must match the data set offered by CDEC for
          that location and sensor; it will not retrieve data that does not have that duration
          code. (You need to access the CDEC web site at http://cdec.water.ca.gov to determine what
          data sets are offered with what duration codes.)&nbsp; A default F part of “CDEC” will be
          set but you can change that, if desired. &nbsp;If you need to add additional rows, select
          the <b>Edit</b> menu and then <b>Insert Rows</b>.&nbsp; Fill in the identifiers for any
          remaining stations that you want.&nbsp; Once you have completed your table, save it using
          <b>Save</b> from the <b>File</b> menu.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can sort the station table by pressing on the column header of the column that you
          want to sort by.&nbsp; A second press of the column header will perform an inverse sort.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can get a list of all sensor numbers, PE Codes and other information that CDEC has
          available by selecting <b>Stations Definitions</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu, as shown
          below.&nbsp; These are the codes that CDEC uses, not necessarily what is available for
          each station.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
           <img src="../ImagesExt/image21_50.jpg" border="0"><br>
           List of Station Definitions<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          To retrieve data from the CDEC web site and import into HEC-DSS, open or fill-in the
          station table as describe above, and then enter the start date and end date for the time
          frame that you want data for.&nbsp; (The date boxes cannot be empty like they can for the
          USGS plug-in.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The date should be entered in the form of DDMMMYYY
          (e.g., 03FEB2005).&nbsp; Selecting the small box in the date field will provide a
          calendar tool to aid in setting the date.&nbsp; Even though you may specify dates, only
          data that is available within those dates from the web site can be retrieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          You should check the CDEC web site (at http://cdec.water.ca.gov) to verify what data is
          available for the stations that you are interested in.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          After the data type and time span have been set, select the stations from the table that
          you want data for by checking the box in the <b>Get Data</b> column for those
          stations.&nbsp; If you want to retrieve data for all stations in your table, press the
          <b>Select All</b> button.&nbsp; The data retrieval process will begin when you press the
          <b>Get Data</b> button.&nbsp; This operation will take some time, depending on your
          connection speed to the internet and how much data you have requested.&nbsp; A
          <b>Retrieve Progress</b> dialog box will display the progress of the process.&nbsp; After
          data has been retrieved, the main catalog screen in HEC-DSSVue will be automatically
          updated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monthly, daily and hourly data will be stored with an E part of “1MON”, “1DAY”, or
          “1HOUR”, respectively.&nbsp; Event data will be stored in an irregular-interval format
          with an E part of “IR-MONTH”.&nbsp; You may want to use the interval modification
          functions available from the <b>Time Functions</b> tab in the <b>Math Functions</b>
          screen to change the data to a desired interval.
        </li>
        <li>
          The CDEC plug-in currently has limited error detection capabilities.&nbsp; If you think
          there are problems, you should check the HEC-DSSVue log screen for messages.&nbsp; The
          log screen is usually minimized in your task bar.&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         The CDEC plug-in will indicate when data cannot be retrieved, but it may not give the
        reason why.&nbsp; You should check the CDEC web page with a browser to ensure that what you
        are requesting is available.&nbsp; The web address is:&nbsp; http://cdec.water.ca.gov.
