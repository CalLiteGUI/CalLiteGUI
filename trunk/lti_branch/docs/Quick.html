    <p>
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Quick Results dashboard is where
      graphs and tables can be generated for</font> <font face=
      "SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">numerous CalLite outputs, for one scenario or
      comparing different scenarios. &nbsp;The different sections on this tab are as
      follows:</font>

    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Scenarios.</b></font> <font face=
      "SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">&nbsp;Here the user can add or delete scenarios from a
      list of scenarios whose results will be displayed, and select the type of results to show
      (either for a single scenario (Base option), a&nbsp;comparison of scenarios, or the
      difference between scenarios). &nbsp;The radio button next to each scenario name can be used
      to select which scenario to delet, and for difference plots it also controls which scenario
      the other scenarios are compared to when computing the difference values. &nbsp;
      &nbsp;</font>

    <p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-Whether to show flow data in cfs or taf.
      &nbsp;Plots of variables other than flow have fixed units (taf for storages,
      umhos/cm&nbsp;for salinity).</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-Whether to show a monthly time
      series&nbsp;or exceedance plot. &nbsp;Exceedance plots can be shown for individual months,
      all monthly values, or annual totals. &nbsp;The annual total exceedance plots are only shown
      for flow variables and the units are always taf.</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-Whether to show a table of monthly
      values. &nbsp;For flow variables this table will also show an annual total which is always in
      taf.</font>

    <p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">-Whether to show a summary table.
      &nbsp;The summary table can show five different statistics (average, maximum, minimum,
      standard deviation, and median) computed from monthly and annual values, summarized by four
      different water year types and for the three driest periods in 1922-2003. &nbsp;When
      summarizing data by water year type, the Sacramento Valley 40-30-30 Index, Feather Index, and

       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Report List.</b></font> <font face=

      include different selections of multiple graphs and tables. &nbsp;Clicking the Add to List
      button will add a report to the list that includes all the variables whose checkboxes are
      active with all the options selected in the Scenario and Display areas. &nbsp;Reports on the
      list can then be displayed (singly or all at once) and saved for later use. Saved lists can
      be reloaded using the Load List button.</font>

      activated checkboxes can be added to a report list (see above).</font> <font face=
      "SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Storage and Flows tab allows the user to choose
      from a variety of standard output variables for flow, storage, and salinity. &nbsp;The
      Shortages/Flow Objectives tab allows the user to display shortages in accretion/depletion
      (AD) terms in the North of Delta area; and compare Delta outflow and Sacramento and San
      Joaquin River flows to the SWRCB Delta Flow Criteria. &nbsp;The Water Management Actions tab
      is currently not active. &nbsp;</font>

       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">When graphs are displayed it is possible

      &nbsp;Once zoomed in you can pan by holding down the left button and the Control key, and
      then moving the mouse. &nbsp;Right clicking in the graph area will bring up a menu that
      allows you to edit properties of the graph; copy, save, and print the graph; zoom in, zoom
      out, and reset the plot to its original zoom; and copy the data used to create the graph into
      the clipboard, from where it can pasted into another application. &nbsp;Certain graphs also
      display&nbsp;secondary time series (described in the legend) in addition to the primary time
