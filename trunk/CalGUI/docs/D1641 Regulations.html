       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>3.5.1. D-1641 Regulations</b></font>
    </p>
    <p>
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The regulations that are selectable on
      this tab are all from the State Water Resources Control Board Decision 1641 (D-1641).
      &nbsp;These regulations are summarized below, but for a more detail on the D-1641 standards,
      see Appendices B and C of the User's Reference Manual. Clicking the checkbox next to a
      regulation will activate it for the current CalLite scenario. &nbsp;For all of these
      regulations except the salinity standards and the pulse period export cap based on Vernalis
      flow, D-1641 standards can be replaced with user-defined standards. &nbsp;If this is desired,
      after turning on the regulation, click on the radio button for user defined&nbsp;and enter
      desired values in the editable table (on the right half of the screen). &nbsp;The month
      numbers in the user-defined tables refer to water year months, so Oct = 1, Nov =2
      etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p>
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The regulations on this tab are as
      follows:</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Delta Cross Channel (DCC).</b>
      &nbsp;This defines the numbers of days that the DCC gates are open in each month.
      &nbsp;Operation of the DCC assists in transferring fresh water from the Sacramento River
      across the Delta. &nbsp;Operations depend on water quality, flood protection, and fish and
      wildlife requirements.</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Sacramento River at Rio Vista Minimum
      Flow.</b> &nbsp;This defines minimum flows at Rio Vista, which vary by month and water year
      type.</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Minimum Net Delta Outflow.</b>
      &nbsp;This defines minimum outflows through the Delta. &nbsp;User-defined values can be set
      by month and water year type.</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-X2 Requirements.</b> &nbsp;This
      defines the distance (in km) from the Golden Gate Bridge of the X2 position (salinity of 2
      parts per thousand) in the Delta. &nbsp;The checkbox for Roe Trigger can be used to turn on
      or off the D-1641&nbsp;standard for days that X2 is west of Roe Island, which is enforced
      when the previous months X2 position was west of Roe Island. &nbsp;When user-defined the
      regulation can be turned on or off and&nbsp;values can be set by month and water year type,
      and there is no Roe Trigger.</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Export-Inflow Ratio.</b> &nbsp;This
      limits the combined exports of CVP and SWP to a specific proportion of total Delta outflow.
      &nbsp;When user-defined this proportion (ratio) can be adjusted by month.</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Vernalis-Based Export Restriction.
      &nbsp;</b>This limits the combined exports of CVP and SWP to the maximum of 1500 cfs or San
      Joaquin River flow at Vernalis. &nbsp;This restriction only applies during the Apr 15-May 15
      pulse period.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">
       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><b>-Salinity Standards</b> at Emmaton
      and&nbsp;Jersey Point (for agriculture), Rock Slough (for M&amp;I), and Collinsville (for
      fish and wildlife). &nbsp;</font>
