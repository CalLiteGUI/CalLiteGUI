       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Run Settings dashboard allows the user
      to load, save, run, and view scenarios settings; enter a scenario description; &nbsp;specify
      the run period, run type, and run basis.</font>

       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Scenario settings are saved with a file

       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The run period can be any period starting
      no earlier than Oct 1921 and ending no later than Sept 2003 (USGS water years 1922-2003).
      &nbsp;In this version of CalLite, only deterministic run types are possible.
      &nbsp;Probabilistic runs will be added in later versions of the model. &nbsp;The run basis
      determines the type of CalSim II run that the CalLite run is based on. &nbsp;Currently two
      run bases are available - Biological Opinion RPAs and Pre-Biological Opinion RPAs. &nbsp;The
      base CalSim II run primarily affects the&nbsp;AD (accretion/depletion) terms that are used in
      CalLite. &nbsp;Sometimes there may be shortages associated with AD terms in the North of
      Delta area, and in this case CalLite will display a warning message at the end of the
      simulation. &nbsp;See Appendix A of the</font> <font face=

      "SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">for a further description of AD terms and
      shortages.</font>
