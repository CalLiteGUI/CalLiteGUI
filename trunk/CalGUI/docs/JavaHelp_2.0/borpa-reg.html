<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>3.5.2. 
 Biological Opinion RPAs Tab</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">The 
 standards listed on this tab&#160;are from the Fish and Wildlife Service 
 (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Biological Opinions 
 on operations of the CVP and SWP, released in Dec. 2008 and June 2009 
 respectively. &#160;The specific standards here are Reasonable and Prudent 
 Alternatives (RPAs) described in those Biological Opinions. &#160;See 
 Appendix B in the CalLite Reference Manual&#160;for more description of 
 these RPAs. &#160;As with D-1641 regulations, activating the appropriate 
 checkbox will turn on the standard. &#160;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">While 
 there are no user-defined options for these RPAs, for three of them there 
 is a user-defined standard on another tab that could conflict with the 
 RPA standard. &#160;This occurs for the Old and Middle River RPA (see 
 the Other Regulation tab) and the Fall X2 and Delta Cross Channel RPAs 
 (see the D-1641 tab). &#160;To reduce confusion about which regulatory 
 standard to apply, these three RPA standards are always automatically 
 deactivated if the corresponding standard is user-defined, even if the 
 RPA checkbox is checked, and in those cases only the user-defined standards 
 apply.&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">The 
 RPAs on this tab are:</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Old and Middle 
 River (FWS RPA Actions 1-3).</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">This limits 
 CVP and SWP&#160;exports so that flow in the Old and Middle River is no 
 more negative than a specified standard during Dec-June. &#160;Depending 
 on the time of year and hydrological&#160;and biological conditions this 
 standard can vary from -1,250 to -5,000 cfs. &#160;</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Fall X2 (FWS 
 RPA Action 4). &#160;</b>This sets X2 standards for Sept-Nov, which are 
 applied in Wet and Above Normal water years. &#160;Since this RPA applies 
 in different months than the D-1641 X2 standard, both can be applied in 
 the same scenario.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Clear Creek 
 (NMFS RPA Action 1.1.1). &#160;</b>This sets minimum flow standards in 
 Clear Creek.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-Delta Cross 
 Channel (NMFS RPA Action 4.1.2).</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">This 
 defines the number of days that the DCC gates are open in each month. 
 &#160;DCC operations under this RPA will always have no more days open 
 than the D-1641 DCC standard, and in some months may have even fewer days 
 open. &#160;Since this RPA was crafted as extra protection above and beyond 
 the D-1641 standard, it will operate identically whether or not the D-1641 
 DCC standard is explicitly activated in the GUI.&#160;&#160;&#160;</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><b>-San Joaquin 
 River Inflow to Export Ratio (NMFS RPA Action 4.2.1).</b></font> <font face="Verdana" class="hcp1">This 
 limits the combined exports of CVP and SWP to a fraction of San Joaquin 
 River at Vernalis, which varies by water year type.</font></p>
<p class="hcp2"><font color="#FF0000" face="Verdana" class="hcp1"><img 
	 src="icon-warn.png" alt="warning" width="25" height="24" border="0" />WARNING: 
 Any user defined values will be used in place of the Biological Opinion 
 regulations. This applies to X2, Old Middle River, and San Joaquin River 
 Inflow/Export Index user defined options.</font></p>
