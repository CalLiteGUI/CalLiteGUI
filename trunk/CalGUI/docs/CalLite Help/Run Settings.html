       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Run Settings dashboard allows the user
      to load, save, and run scenarios, enter a scenario description, and&nbsp;specify the run
      period, run type, and run basis. &nbsp;The run period can be any period starting no earlier
      than Oct 1921 and ending no later than Sept 2003 (USGS water years 1922-2003). &nbsp;In this
      version of CalLite, only deterministic run types are possible. &nbsp;Probabilistic runs will
      be added in later versions of the model. &nbsp;The run basis determines the type of CalSim II
      run that the CalLite run is based on. &nbsp;Currently it is only possible for the run basis
      to be a CalSim&nbsp;II run that incorporates Biological Opinion RPAs. &nbsp;The base CalSim
      run primarily affects the&nbsp;AD (accretion/depletion) terms that are used in CalLite.
      &nbsp;Sometimes there may be shortages associated with AD terms in the North of Delta area,
      and in this case CalLite will display a warning message at the end of the simulation.
      &nbsp;See Appendix A of the User's Reference Manual for a further description of AD terms and
      shortages.</font>
