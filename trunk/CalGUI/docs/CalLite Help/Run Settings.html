       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">The Run Settings tab allows the user to
      load, save, and run scenarios, enter a scenario description, and&nbsp;specify the run period,
      run type, and run basis. &nbsp;The run period can be any period starting no earlier than Oct
      1921 and ending no later than Sept 2003 (water years 1922-2003). &nbsp;In this version of
      CalLite, only deterministic run types are possible. &nbsp;Probabilistic runs will be added in
      later version of the model. &nbsp;The run basis determines the type of CALSIM II run that the
      CalLite run is based on. &nbsp;Currently it is only possible for the run basis to be a
      CALSIM&nbsp;II run that incorporates Biological Opinion RPAs. &nbsp;The base CALSIM run
      primarily affects the&nbsp;AD (accretion-depletion) terms that are used in CalLite. &nbsp;See
      Appendix A of the User's Reference Manual for a further description of AD terms.
