       <font face="SansSerif, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">This brief write-up describes the main
      features and general use of the prototype version of the Central Valley Water Management
      Screening Model (CalLite). The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and Department of
      Water Resources (DWR) were seeking a simplified version of the current planning model that
      could be used to rapidly evaluate alternative operations or facilities at a screening
      level.&nbsp; This version of CalLite, described herein, contains the most significant
      functionality of a larger, more complex planning model, such as CALSIM II, but is simplified
      in its spatial and hydrologic detail. Despite the simplifications included in CalLite, the
      model results correlate very well to those of a comparable CALSIM II study. The power of a
      screening model such as CalLite is the ability to rapidly simulate system operations and to
      incorporate changes with relative ease. The current version of CalLite simulates system
      operations on a monthly basis for the full 82-yr period of record in less than 5 minutes,
      incorporates a linked planning-forecast model structure, allows probabilistic simulation, and
      incorporates dynamic graphical displays of results from either independent scenario
      simulations or Monte Carlo analyses. The current version emulates the operations and
      hydrology of an existing (Year 2005) and future (Year 2030) level of developments. The model
      can be run with stand-alone D-1641 or user defined Delta regulations. CalLite shows
      considerable promise as a tool for bridging the gap between more detailed planning models and
      agency and stakeholder demand for a rapid screening tool. It should be noted that a tool such
      as CalLite should be customized for each suite of problems to allow for greater applicability
      and interaction from stakeholders.</font>
