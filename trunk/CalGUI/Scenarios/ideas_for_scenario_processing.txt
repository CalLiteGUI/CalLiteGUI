Proposal

(1) User cannot run an unsaved scenario.

(2) When a scenario, e.g., “example1.cls” is saved,

	1. A folder named “example1” is created in the “scenario” folder
	2. In the “example1” folder, a file named “example1.config” and a “Run” folder are created
	3. In the “Run” folder, “Lookup” and “External” folders are created
	4. CalGUI generates the table files for this scenario and place them in the lookup folder
	5. CalGUI Copy the required dll files for this scenario and place them in the external folder
	6. The "example1.config" file is similiar to the *.sty file
